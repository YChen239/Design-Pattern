## Creational design patterns

### Abstract Factory ï¼ˆStrategy Pattern)

Creates an instance of several families of classes

#### Example

The purpose of the Abstract Factory is to provide an ***interface*** for creating families of related objects, ***without specifying concrete classes***. This pattern is found in the sheet metal stamping equipment used in the manufacture of Japanese automobiles. The ***stamping equipment*** is an Abstract Factory which creates auto body parts. The same machinery is used to stamp right hand doors, left hand doors, right front fenders, left front fenders, hoods, etc. for different models of cars. Through the use of rollers to change the stamping dies, the concrete classes produced by the machinery can be changed within three minutes.
